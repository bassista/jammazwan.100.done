### jammazwan.100.done

This is the same workspace as [jammazwan.100]() except these projects are already done.

Well, 85 or so are done. To some degree of completion.

### Not Done

 * You won't find any CXF WSDL first projects done. Didn't get around to those yet.
 * Didn't do much of any unit tests.
 * First few projects aaa and so on seem to be lame or not done, not sure why.
