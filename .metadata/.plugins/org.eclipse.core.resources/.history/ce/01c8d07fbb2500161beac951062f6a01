Goals:
- push your skills past your Camel comfort zone
- increase your speed and agility through reps
- provide minimal example boilerplate so you can focus on value-add skills
	
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
    - in at least one area, catch exceptions and deal with them with a handler
    - use the "act surprised method" and do no testing of any sort
PSEUDOCODE FOR ROUTES
    - template.sendBody([some String by you]) FROM INSIDE JUNIT TEST
    [1st route]
    - your message body is now a simple string
    - to JMS endpoint
    [2nd route]
    - from JMS endpoint
    - use the Recipient List EIPattern to create dispatch(s) by some kind of reasonable logic
    - consume or modify headers of your message as part of this 'reasonable logic'
FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
    - modify to create your camel contex in java
    - add a script, or manually if only option, deploying to Fabric8
    - write your routes in xml, unless you already did in your first pass
