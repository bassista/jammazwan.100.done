# jammazwan.100

This README and a separately downloadable tar, below, are about all that this project consists of. 

You may want to read these minimal instructions very carefully before doing anything, to save yourself some time.

### What jammazwan.100 is/does:

Jammazwan 100 gives you 100 starter projects in single workspace, with a set of README instructions on how to complete these projects.

It will put you through maybe not 100, (there may be dupes as it is randomly generated) but lots and lots and lots of variations of Camel integration projects. From JPA to CSX to JMS to .... different combinations of each.  

When you start out, it may take quite a bit of time for each unfamiliar project, as you'll have to gather up the configuration details. 

But once you get them down, it may take as little as 10-15 minutes per project. By the end, your Camel skills will be greatly solidified.

### How To:

Download the workspace tar from here: (github doesn't much like larger binaries)

http://docs.datafundamentals.com/jammazwan/jammazwan100.tar.gz

 * uncompress tar as a folder
 * open workspace folder as clean workspace (in eclipse as default, or your own favorite)
 * import as "Existing eclipse projects" any or all 
 * separately, you may or may not wish to open the file named jammazwanBatch100.txt 
 * you are now ready to write 200+ routes and test your speed.
 
### Cheat sheets

I am including my own text file as the only source in this github project. It is mostly gibberish to anyone else, but it does have almost all of the text you would need to copy into various files to complete the projects.
