### ${headers.projectName}

Welcome to ${headers.projectName}

This project is a code demo project - designed to isolate functionality and make it easy replicate-able. Specifically:

**_${headers.projectName}_**

#### Dependencies First:

Relax! This project runs almost all by itself, no huge web of parent poms to obfuscate what is going on under the covers.

But it does have *one* dependency, so you always have to git clone that into the same folder first, 
then run mvn install on that first, before messing with this project.
