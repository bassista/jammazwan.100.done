# jammazwan.docker

This is a simple project to demonstrate how you can use docker to set up supporting infrastructure for your camel learning projects, without spending hours doing machine admin.

It assumes you already have your machine set up to run docker, but if that isn't the case you have a whole different set of problems. Docker is inevitable. Resistance is futile.
