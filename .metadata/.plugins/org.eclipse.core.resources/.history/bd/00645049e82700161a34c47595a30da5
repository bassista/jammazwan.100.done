Welcome to ${headers.projectName}

Relax! This project runs almost all by itself, no huge web of parent poms to obfuscate what is going on under the covers.

But it does have one dependency, so you always have to git clone it into the same folder first, 
then run mvn install on that first, before messing with this project.
